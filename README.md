# Type Error: Adding Number and String in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript involving the addition of a number and a string. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return their sum. However, the example call passes a string ('10') as the second argument, which causes a type error.

The solution involves type checking or type assertion to ensure both arguments are numbers before performing the addition.
